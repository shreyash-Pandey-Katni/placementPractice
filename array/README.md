# Array Problems

This folder contains solutions to various array-related problems in C++ and Java. Each file is named after the problem it solves. For example:
- `maxSumContiguousSubarray.cpp`: Kadane's algorithm for maximum subarray sum
- `maximumGap.java`: Maximum gap using bucket sort

If a problem has both C++ and Java solutions, both files are present.

## Subtopics
If this folder grows too large, consider organizing by subtopics:
- `sorting/`
- `searching/`
- `subarrays/`

## How to Use
Open any file to see the implementation and comments. Most files are self-contained and can be compiled/run directly.
